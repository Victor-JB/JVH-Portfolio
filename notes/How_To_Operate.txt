LOCAL DEV:
1. The run-dev.sh file does all of the mkcert https certificate installation
and also boots the app, docs should be contained within the file

PROD:
1. Run the setup-prod-services.ps1 powershell, it builds the app...
 - that runs start-app-prod.bat which runs the python uvicorn app
 - setup-services sets up the nssm joulinphotos_nssm_serice + caddy services, which are the names of the background tasks
running via nssm
 - then there is the github webhook to setup (techically optional) that also has a setup-webhook-infra.ps1 that you run
 - the certificates are managed automatically by caddy, an caddy is set up via my Caddyfile, so that's nice

2. Refer to APP-FLOW.md file for how the app flow works; I would recommend just looking at
the primary driver files aptly named driver.js and fsm.js. FSM (finite state machine)
defines the state machine that drives state transitions within the app; not that
there are that many, but still a useful abstraction imo

Useful commands (custom commands created on Joulin server):
1. nssm_list -- my custom command to list all set up NSSM apps and their status (running, stopped, etc.)

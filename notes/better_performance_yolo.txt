Strategies for increasing performance:

5 | Classical image-processing baselines
Especially useful as post-processing for the ML masks:

Color thresholding & morphological ops – Bright-orange rings are easy to isolate; apply opening → distance transform → watershed to split touching foams.
Edge-based shape detection – Hough circles / rectangles to detect individual ring profiles.
Motion cues – Ask the shipper to give the tray a tiny shake; frame differencing separates stacked layers.
Controlled capture – Place products on a matte, high-contrast “placemat”, add a top-down LED ring, and fix camera height. This alone can boost SAM’s instance separation accuracy by double-digit percentages.
